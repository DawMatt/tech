# Install - Windows Package and Application Management

The package and application management tools utilised (in order of preference) are:

1. [Winget](install/winget.md)
2. [Chocolatey](install/choco.md)

Winget is Microsoft's package manager for Windows. While more recently released it has a growing selection of packages available and can also manage/upgrade applications that weren't installed by winget.

Chocolatey has been around for longer and has a number of packages not yet available via winget.

Both have their merits but we are utilising winget as our primary choice. We expect that winget will have wider take up and over time the package repository will expand to the point that choco will no longer be required as well. In addition we expect winget to be more acceptable to IT departments so is more likely to be available on both work and personal devices.
